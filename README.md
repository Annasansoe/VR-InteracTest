VR InteracTest is an experimental platform for testing different interaction methods and metaphors. The application consist of three meticulously designed scenes, which simulate real-world tasks, and offer users an opportunity to interact with each scene. The available methods of interaction are controllers and hand tracking, which can be combined with ray-casting or direct interaction as metaphor. Overall, VR InteracTest enables a comprehensive analysis of user behaviour across the two input modalities.
Furthermore, the application includes data collection mechanisms to record user interactions, capturing metrics such as task completion time, accuracy, and user preferences. A focus group, comprising both university students and non-expert of VR, took part in the study, providing the broader insights.
